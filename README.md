# README

This is a template repository for running Elasticsearch on Render. 

* It uses [Render Disks](https://render.com/docs/disks) for persistent index storage.

* Elasticsearch runs in your [Render private network](https://render.com/docs/private-services), so it is only available to your Render apps.

## Deployment

See https://render.com/docs/elasticsearch.
