# README

This is a template repository for running Elasticsearch on Render. It uses [Render Disks](https://render.com/docs/disks) for persistent data storage and [Render Private Networking](https://render.com/docs/private-services) to make Elasticsearch available to your Render apps without exposing it to the public Internet.

## Deployment

See https://render.com/docs/deploy-elasticsearch.
